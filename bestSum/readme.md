Problem:
Write a function `bestSum(targetSum,numbers)` that takes in a targetSum and an array of numbers as arguments.

the function should return an array containing the _shortest_ combination of numbers that add up to exactly the targetSum.

If there is a tie for the shortest combination, you may return any one of the shortest.

testCases:

`console.log(bestSum(7, [5, 3, 4, 7])); // [7] console.log(bestSum(8, [2, 3, 5])); // [3, console.log(bestSum(8, [1, 4, 15])); // [4,4] console.log(bestSum(100, [1, 2, 5, 25])); //[ 25, 25, 25, 25]`
